/- Problem 1.1 Cutting Up a Log
you have a log which is 7 meters long
how long does it take to cut it assuming each cut takes a minute?
1m peices

how about for log of size n

example {w : â„š} (h1 : c = 1) (h2 : l = 7)(h3 : t = (l-1)*c ) :
 t = 6 :=
  calc
    t = t := by ring
    _ = t := by ring

    _ = (l-1)*c := by rw[h3]
    _ = (7-1)*(1) := by rw[h1,h2]
    _ = (6)*(1) := by ring
    _ = 6 := by ring
